# The goal of this project is to create a brochure website for the Laura Folk Fair, a small town fair in South Australia.

- they currently have a website that they lost the domain to, and that site will go down soon
- they tried to create a new website with a non-dev and decided the quality wasn't good enough
- they have commissioned me to make a more professional looking brochure site advertising their town fair event
- The non-dev made website is: https://www.laurafolkfair.org.au/
- We will get a lot of our content from this
- Also get content from https://laurasa.com.au/laura-fair/ which is the official website for the town of Laura. Scrape content from all pages here
- The style, colors and layout will be based on https://www.aussieworld.com.au/
- There will be no ticketing feature, only a contact page
- The site will be made with html, tailwind css and Google fonts and icons
- The site must be responsive and have great SEO
- Aside from the home page and the contact page, decide on what other content should be in a separate page based on convention for event brochure sites and seo requirements
- use placeholder images where needed as content will be added later in development
- I have 3 images so far in the root directory. Move them if needed and use where needed
